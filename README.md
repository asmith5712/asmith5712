Hello. I'm Adalyn Smith.

I'm a student in Computer Science attending Blue Ridge Community College. 
I plan to transfer to James Madison University when I graduate in the summer.
I've been coding for about three and a half years.
I'm also interested in information technology on top of computer science.
